### Import statements quality
1. Do not change the import order of existing import files and packages, just add the new ones
2. Avoid wild card imports

### Functions usage
1. Do not change the private functions to public unless we want other packages to use it
2. If the same package is using the function then keep it private

### Code comments and documentation
1. Add comments only when necessary, do not add comments when the code itself gives the understanding
2. Add comments for architectural decision
