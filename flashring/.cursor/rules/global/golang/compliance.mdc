# Rule Compliance Tracking

## Response Format Requirement
When responding to user queries about code patterns, architecture, or implementation examples:

1. **Always List Obeyed Rules**: At the end of your response, include a section titled "**Rules Followed:**" that lists the specific rules from the codebase that are being obeyed or demonstrated in your response.

2. **Rule Identification**: Identify rules from the following files:
   - `.cursor/rules/unit-testing.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/requirement-planning.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/code-quality.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/compliance.mdc`

3. **Example Format**:
   ```
   **Rules Followed:**
   - Dependency Injection Pattern
   - Configuration Management
   - Interface Design
   ```

4. **Context Awareness**: Only list rules that are actually relevant to the specific response or examples provided.

5. **Rule Verification**: When analyzing code examples, verify which rule categories are being followed and explicitly mention the rule headings.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Scan the codebase for examples that demonstrate rule compliance
- Provide concrete code examples when possible
- Explain how the examples follow the specific rule categories
- Use the rule headings/categories from the source files when listing them
