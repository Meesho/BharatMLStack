Online-feature-store is a high-performance, scalable, and production-grade feature store built for modern machine learning systems. It supports both **real-time** and **batch** workflows, with a strong emphasis on **developer experience**, **system observability**, and **low-latency feature retrieval**.

Designed for high-scale real-time inference workloads, Online-feature-store ensures:

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Ultra-low latency** - Ultra-low retrieval times at scale
- üöÄ **High throughput** - Tested to serve millions of QPS with hundreds of entity IDs per request
- üõ°Ô∏è **High availability** - Designed for mission-critical ML systems with multi-layer storage
- üß† **Multi-format support** - Scalar, vector/embedding, and quantized feature types
- üìà **Comprehensive observability** - Full metrics with Prometheus and Grafana
- üîÑ **Hybrid ingestion** - Seamless batch and real-time feature updates

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Online-feature-store consists of several key components working together:

- **Feature Generation** - Ingest features from existing offline sources or custom feature pipelines
- **Kafka Layer** - Buffered streaming ingestion with flow control
- **Horizon Control Plane** - Configuration management with TruffleBox UI
- **Online-feature-store Consumer** - Ingestion workhorse for writes into online stores
- **Online-feature-store gRPC API Server** - Low-latency feature retrieval and high-consistency ingestion
- **Storage Backends** - Redis/Dragonfly for caching and ScyllaDB for persistence

## üöÄ Quick Start

For detailed setup instructions, see the [**Quick Start Guide**](quick-start/README.md).

The quickest way to get started with Online-feature-store is to use the quick start scripts:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Meesho/BharatMLStack.git
cd BharatMLStack/online-feature-store/quick-start

# Start Online-feature-store and all dependencies
./start.sh
```

This will spin up a complete Online-feature-store environment with:
- ScyllaDB, MySQL, Redis, and etcd databases
- Horizon backend API (port 8082)
- TruffleBox UI (port 3000)
- Online-feature-store gRPC API Server (port 8089)

To stop all services:
```bash
./stop.sh
```

## üß∞ SDKs

Online-feature-store provides SDKs to interact with the feature store:

- **[Go SDK](sdks/go/README.md)** - For backend services and ML inference
- **[Python SDK](sdks/python/README.md)** - For feature ingestion and Spark jobs

## üí° Key Features

- **Low-latency retrieval** - In-memory LRU caches and efficient binary formats
- **Efficient storage** - Optimized binary data blocks with PSDBBlocks and CSDBBlocks
- **Cache hierarchy** - Multi-level caching with Redis/Dragonfly and in-memory options
- **Schema versioning** - Safe evolution of feature schemas with backward compatibility
- **Operational simplicity** - Centralized configuration via TruffleBox UI
- **Comprehensive monitoring** - Deep visibility into system performance with Prometheus/Grafana

## üìä Use Cases

Online-feature-store is ideal for:

- **Real-time inference** - Low-latency feature serving for online ML models, like Ranking and Recommendation, Fraud detection, Search, Dynamic pricing and bidding, real-time notification etc real time 
- **Feature Catalogue** - Centralized feature registry for organizations
- **Flexible Data Ingestion** - Support for batch processing, streaming pipelines, and real-time data sources with unified ingestion APIs

## üñ•Ô∏è UI and Management

TruffleBox provides a comprehensive UI for:

- Entity and feature group registration
- Feature discovery and metadata management
- TTL and caching configuration
- Request approval workflows

To access the UI after starting Online-feature-store:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
